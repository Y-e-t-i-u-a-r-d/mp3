# STEREO TYPE

Stereotype is a [scrapped](https://oddfuture.blogspot.com/2007/12/parent-conference.html) album by Tyler, The Creator or (Ace). Made in 2007 and uploaded to his MySpace in response to his mother and school counselors telling him he can't drop it. Stereotype shows sounds and themes that would later be present in such albums as Wolf, Flower Boy, and most evidently IGOR. Even the cover has a similar artistical style to IGOR and is likely a reference to Andy Warhol’s prints of images back in 1962. The official full tracklist and most songs are lost and only the instrumental to the tracks remain. Odd toddlers, I Dream, Retail Price, 12:01 ft MP, and Lounges and Blox were all originally on stereotype with videos of Tyler performing Odd Toddlers going back as far as 2008. Most of those tracks made it to Tylers other album uploaded to his MySpace (At Your Own Risk) with Odd Toddlers going on to Bastard instead. It is likely that the full album will never be found but efforts will be made. Lyric tracks have been found for songs such as Pancakes, Secret Garden and Sorry.

Some quality was lost when converting M4A to MP3. You can find the originals below.
