# Goblin

Goblin is Tyler, The Creator’s major label debut and second album overall, released in May 10, 2011. The album features the rapper’s most controversial lines that involve homophobia and misogyny, such as in the song “Tron Cat,” in which Tyler raps:

Victim, victim, honey, you’re my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome

As well as the album featuring Tyler’s breakout single, “Yonkers.”

The California native continues the story between him and his therapist, Dr. TC, as he appeared on his first solo project, Bastard. As the sessions progress, Tyler loses touch of reality and kills all of his friends, just to realize that all of the characters, including Dr. TC are all just a part of his imagination.

This is the second project to have the last track complete the title for the project, as it can also be seen in Bastard, as the final track is titled “Inglorious.”
